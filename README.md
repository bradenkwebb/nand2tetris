# nand2tetris
This repository contains my code for [Nand to Tetris Parts I & II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). I'm auditing this course through Coursera at the recommendation of the [core systems curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-systems) of the Open Source Society University's Computer Science program.

All initial boilerplate code is taken directly from [Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan's work](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software), but the actual implementations of the gates and chips specified by the course are all my own work.
